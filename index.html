          Hey, I'm Coop - I'm passionate about Code, Music, Digital Media &
          Marketing, and UI/UX. I built this site using HTML, CSS, and
          Bootstrap, and have experience working with JavaScript, ReactJS,
          NodeJS, SASS, Materialize, Express, jQuery, MongoDB, Python, Django,
          PostgreSQL, Axios, Git, Github, Wordpress, and the USAePay API. I
          graduated General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Program in
          November 2019, and have been working on contract at Marketing Verge as
          a Full Stack Developer.

            >BB'z Questions</a
          >
          is a collection of questions split into various categories. This
          project is intended for use by new friends, old friends, family,
          anyone you hope to get closer to or have some fun with. So often we
          are paralyzed by social interactions and overthinking that we don't
          even begin to converse with each other, always resorting to small
          talk; I've been doing well, the weather is good, so was my weekend.
          While you may not want to get into personal details with co-workers,
          this project offers a variety of (growing) categories and questions to
          spark up conversations with each other; spend some time debating
          whether savory or sweet is better, or maybe come to the realization
          that you both love the same movies. For those who seek to enrich or
          rebuild existing relationships with friends or family, there are even
          more questions for you. Sometimes all it takes is one question to
          start meaningful conversations and open the door to connection. A huge
          thank you to the Banana Boyz, or "BB'z" for short, for inspiring this
          app idea! Check out the GitHub repository

            >WeWorkout</a
          >
          is an open forum for finding workouts, adding your own workouts, and a
          database to track your weights, reps, sets, and progression, built
          using HTML, CSS, Python, Django, PostgreSQL and Materialize. There is
          full CRUD functionality for workouts and lifts, with required user
          authentication. WeWorkout is deployed to Heroku, and is responsive for
          desktop and mobile. On the Home/Workout page, workouts are listed with
          the user's name and muscle group, followed by form, breathing, and
          progression tips; users can add workouts from this page using the +
          sign. Clicking into a workout will then display all lifts associated
          with that user's muscle group, with the exercise, desired reps, and
          weight; users can add lifts from this page using the + sign, in
          addition to being able to edit and delete both the workout and lift
          info from this page. The Lifts page will display all lifts, where
          users can click on lifts to view, edit, or delete. To add, edit, or
          delete workouts and lifts, users must sign up and be logged in; users
          do not need to be logged in to just view workouts and lifts. For more
          information on the project with examples, check out the GitHub
          repository

          <a href="https://wtsia.github.io/DevQ/" target="_blank">DevQ</a> is a
          study platform for Software Engineers, built as a team project at

          questions, which will then take users to the question page; the
          question page will dynamically fill with questions matching that type,
          with an input to note their answer, a hint, an answer, and a link to
          an addtional resource for continued reading. On this page, users can
          choose to edit the question, which will direct them to the edit page;
          on the edit page, users will then re-enter the information for the
          question with any edits they wish to make, with the option to delete
          the question altogether. To create new questions, users can click on
          the "Q+", which will direct them to the new question page. On this
          page, users will enter the question, hint, answer, a link to
          additional resources, and question type, with all inputs being
          required. Submitting the question will push them to the database,
          where they will then be requested and displayed in their respective
          category types when the user goes back to questions. For more
